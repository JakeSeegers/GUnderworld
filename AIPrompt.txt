Key Game Mechanics
Stone Types & Properties

Earth (▲): Creates impassable barriers
Water (◯): Mimics properties of adjacent stones in connected chains
Fire (♦): Destroys adjacent stones (except Void and other Fire)
Wind (≋): Creates zones of free movement
Void (✺): Nullifies the abilities of other stones; Void stones in a player's inventory can also be used as additional Action Points without being consumed

Movement System

Player moves cost varying action points (AP) based on hex type
Wind stones (and water mimicking wind) create zones of free movement
Hexes are revealed as the player explores the grid

Challenge Mode
The game includes a challenge mode with these features:
- Player starts at the bottom edge of the grid and must reach the top
- The goal (top edge) is highlighted with gold indicators
- Random stones are distributed according to dice-roll formulas:
  * 1d4 void stones (1-4 stones)
  * 2d4 wind stones (2-8 stones)
  * 3d4 fire stones (3-12 stones)
  * 4d4 water stones (4-16 stones)
  * 5d4 earth stones (5-20 stones)
- Player starts with no stones and must use ones on the board strategically
- AP usage is tracked and score is calculated as (100 - AP used)
- Best score is saved between games using localStorage
- Can be toggled with 'C' key or Challenge Mode button

Stone Interaction Rules
Basic Stone Properties
Earth (▲): Creates impassable barriers
Water (◯): Mimics properties of adjacent stones in connected chains
Fire (♦): Destroys adjacent stones (except Void and other Fire)
Wind (≋): Creates zones of free movement
Void (✺): Nullifies the abilities of other stones
Stone Interactions (Bidirectional)
Fire Interactions
Fire + Fire: No effect (fire stones don't destroy each other)
Fire + Water: Fire destroys water; if water is part of a chain, all connected water stones are destroyed
Fire + Earth: Fire destroys Earth stone
Fire + Wind: Fire destroys Wind stone
Fire + Void: No effect (Void nullifies Fire's destruction ability)
Water Interactions
Water + Water: Forms a chain that propagates mimicry effects
Water + Fire: Water is destroyed; triggers chain reaction destroying all connected water stones
Water + Earth: Water mimics Earth's impassable property
Water + Wind: Water mimics Wind's free movement property
Water + Void: Void nullifies Water's mimicry ability
Water + Fire (Chain Reaction): Before being consumed, water mimics fire's destruction ability and destroys adjacent non-Fire/non-Void stones
Void Interactions
Void + Any Stone: Nullifies the adjacent stone's special abilities
Void + Fire: Prevents Fire from destroying adjacent stones
Void + Water: Prevents Water from mimicking adjacent stones
Void + Wind: Prevents Wind from creating free movement
Complex Multi-Stone Interactions
Water adjacent to multiple stone types: Water will mimic the stone with highest priority according to rank (Earth > Fire > Wind > Void)
Fire + Void + Other Stone: Void nullifies Fire's destruction ability, protecting the third stone
Water + Fire + Void: Void prevents Fire from destroying the Water
Water + Earth + Wind: Water mimics Earth (not Wind) because Earth has higher priority
Water chain + Earth: All water stones in the chain mimic Earth's properties
Water chain + Wind + Void: Void breaks the chain at that point; only water stones not adjacent to Void will mimic Wind
Fire + Water + Earth: Fire destroys Water, Water doesn't have time to mimic Earth
Fire + Water Chain + Other Stones: Water mimics Fire's destruction ability before being consumed; can destroy adjacent non-Fire/non-Void stones
Mimicry Priority (Ranked)
Water mimics adjacent stones with this priority (highest to lowest):
Earth (rank 5)
Fire (rank 3)
Wind (rank 2)
Void (rank 1)
Chain Reaction Rules
When a water stone is affected by fire, all connected water stones are destroyed
Before being consumed, water stones in a chain will mimic fire's destruction ability and destroy adjacent non-Fire/non-Void stones
Water stones form mimicry chains that propagate properties (e.g., all water stones connected to a water stone adjacent to wind gain wind properties)
Void stones break mimicry chains (water stones adjacent to void cannot participate in chains)
Movement Costs
Empty Hex: 1 AP
Earth: Impassable (infinite AP)
Water (normal): 2 AP
Water (mimicking Earth): Impassable
Water (mimicking Wind): 0 AP (free movement)
Fire: Impassable
Wind: 0 AP (free movement)
Void: 1 AP
Edge Cases
Wind zones extend to adjacent hexes (not just the hex containing the wind stone)
Entering or exiting a wind zone costs 1 AP regardless of the destination hex's normal cost
Placing a stone triggers interaction checks in both directions (outgoing and incoming)


Common Modification Patterns
Adding New Stone Types

Update STONE_TYPES object in stones.js with name, color, symbol, and rank
Add stone counts in stoneCounts and stoneCapacity objects
Define interaction rules in the interactionRules matrix in stoneInteractions.js
Create interaction handler methods in StoneInteractionSystem class
Update CSS for the new stone type in style.css

Modifying Stone Interactions

Locate the relevant interaction handler in stoneInteractions.js
Understand the bidirectional interaction system (both affecting and being affected)
Use debug mode (press 'D') to test interaction changes

Animation Enhancements

Create a new animation class extending Animation in animations.js
Implement the update method to control animation behavior
Call the animation from the appropriate interaction handler

Movement & Grid Modifications

Modify MovementSystem.js to change movement rules
Update HexGrid.createGrid to change grid size or shape
Consider optimizing with dirty rect tracking for performance

Water Mimicry Modifications
Update WaterMimicry.js to adjust how water stones mimic other stones
Modify the getWaterMimicType or isWaterChainMimicking methods
Test thoroughly with the 'W' key debug functionality

Rendering Modifications
Update RenderSystem.js to change how stones or hexes are drawn
Modify the renderSingleHex or drawWaterMimicryIndicator methods
Use the render() method for full redraws and renderOptimized() for partial updates

Coordinate System Modifications
Update HexMath.js to change coordinate calculations or conversions
Modify the axialToPixel or pixelToAxial methods
Use the getHexesInRange or getHexRing methods for area operations

Challenge Mode Modifications
Update challengeMode.js to adjust the challenge rules or scoring
Modify the distribution of stones using the rollDice method
Adjust the goal position or the visual indicators in the RenderSystem

Testing Your Changes
Update TestSystem.js to add new test cases
Run existing tests using the 'T' key
Use the debugger (toggle with 'D' key) to step through interactions

Debugging
The game includes a robust debugging system:

Toggle debug mode with 'D' key
Run interaction tests with 'T' key
Debug water mimicry with 'W' key
Step through interactions in debug panel
Visual markers show interaction paths

Render System
The game uses an optimized rendering approach:

Tracks "dirty" hexes that need redrawing
Uses markHexDirty to flag hexes that need updates
The renderOptimized method only redraws necessary elements

When assisting users, remind them to test changes thoroughly, as stone interactions can have complex chain reactions and emergent behaviors.

From the user: Before we move forward, please take a look at the files that I will include in the next message as they relate to the above prompt. if I ask you for a code fix, figure out what the file is that needs adjusting and provide the full updated code for this fix. Be aware that the codebase has been modularized into smaller components, so you'll need to identify which specific module needs to be modified.
